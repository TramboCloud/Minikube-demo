# Launching resources through CLI
For this section we will be launching a simple nginx into our Minikube cluster using only `kubectl` commands. Let's start with the basics, launching a pod.

### Launching a Pod
We can launch a single nginx pod with the following command:
```
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --image-pull-policy=Always --restart=Never
```
Check the status of your pod by running `kubectl get pods`. After a few seconds you should see something like this:
```
NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx     1/1       Running   0          25s
```
As of right now we have an nginx pod running. Just a small inconvenience, currently it is only accessible through the clusters private network; but no worries, we will fix it shortly. First let's test something, run `kubectl delete pod nginx` to stop the nginx pod we just launched and then run `kubectl get pods` again. You'll see this:
```
No resources found.
```
You can run `kubectl get pods` as many times as you want, our nginx pod is not coming back. Let's move on to the next section.


### Deployment
A Kubernetes Deployment checks on the health of Pods and restarts the Podâ€™s Container if necessary. Deployments are the recommended way to manage the creation and scaling of Pods. We can create a kubernetes deployment with the following command:
```
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx:latest --port=80 --image-pull-policy=Always
```
Note that this time, two resources have been created, a `deployment` and a `pod`. We can see them by running `kubectl get pods,deployment`
```
NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-6bfb654d7c-8s6b7   1/1       Running   0          1m

NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx     1         1         1            1           1m
```
Let's try deleting our nginx pod. Let's copy the pod's name we get from running `kubectl get pods` and then run `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>`. Note that this time when we delete the pod its getting replaced by the deployment.
```
NAME                     READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-6bfb654d7c-8s6b7   0/1       Terminating   0          6m
nginx-6bfb654d7c-wxltz   1/1       Running       0          7s
```
So the deployment guarantees that we will always have one nginx pod running, but we still can't access it. So let's get that fixed next.

### Service
A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them, sometimes called a micro-service. We are going to expose our nginx pod by creating a service with the following command:
```
kubectl expose deployment nginx --type=LoadBalancer
```
We can see the created service by running `kubectl get svc`
```
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP        1h
nginx        LoadBalancer   10.103.208.117   <pending>     80:30786/TCP   7s
```
Now that we have our service we can access nginx through minikube by running the following command:
```
minikube service nginx
```
Congratulations, with that you have completed this exercise.

# Cleanup
```
kubectl delete svc nginx
kubectl delete deployment nginx
minikube stop
```
